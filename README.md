# Data Tokenization and Document Rendering Automation

##Description:
Implemented a data tokenization and document rendering automation project using Python and relevant libraries to replace tokens in a generic scheme Word document with data from a company database stored in a CSV file. The project involved the following key steps:

##Data Retrieval and Transformation:
Utilized the pandas library to read and manipulate data from a CSV file containing company-specific information.
Extracted key data columns and indexed the dataset by the company name for easy access.

##Token Replacement:
Identified and created a list of tokens that needed to be replaced in the Word document.
Leveraged the python-docx library to load the Word document and manipulate its content.
Document Rendering:

Fetched company-specific data by selecting a particular row from the indexed dataset.
Replaced tokens in the Word document with corresponding data using the company-specific data fetched.
Outcome:

Successfully rendered company-specific information in the Word document, automating the manual process of document customization.
Improved efficiency by dynamically generating customized documents based on the company's database, enhancing the workflow.

Tools and Technologies:
Python, pandas, python-docx, CSV handling.
